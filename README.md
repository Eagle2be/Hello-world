Hello-world
===========

I am glad to be here. I am a civil industrial engineer. I like to create and understand things. 
I like to develop things and draw inferences about data for future predictions. 

I like to build trading robots that can match the financial market. 

I am thinking about creating swarm boots that can act together, where their group behaviour shall reveal properties
that do not exist in them as individuals.
